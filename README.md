### 2. Start the Application
```bash
# Start database and API
docker-compose up -d

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 3. Load Sample Data
```bash
# Run ETL process to load CMS data
docker-compose --profile etl up etl

# Or run manually if you have the CSV file

```

### 4. Access the Application
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

## üì° API Endpoints

### Provider Search
```bash
# Search by DRG and location
GET /providers?drg=470&zip=10001&radius_km=50&limit=20

# Example response includes value scores and rankings
{
  "provider_name": "MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL",
  "average_covered_charges": 45230.50,
  "average_rating": 8.2,
  "distance_km": 12.34,
  "value_score": 87.3
}
```

### AI Assistant
```bash
# Natural language queries
POST /ask
{
  "question": "Who has the best value for knee replacement near 10001?"
}

# Returns natural language answer with data grounding
```

### Additional Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Service health and database statistics
- `GET /stats` - Comprehensive database and ranking statistics  
- `GET /examples` - Example AI assistant prompts
- `GET /top-rated` - Highest rated providers (for comparison)
- `GET /cheapest` - Most affordable options (for comparison)

## üí° Example AI Queries

### Cost-Focused Queries
- "Who is the cheapest for DRG 470 within 25 miles of 10001?"
- "Find the most affordable orthopedic hospitals with good ratings"

### Quality-Focused Queries  
- "What are the best rated hospitals for heart surgery in New York?"
- "Which hospitals have the highest ratings for cardiac procedures?"

### Value-Focused Queries (Default)
- "Show me the best value hospitals for knee replacement near Manhattan"
- "Which hospital offers the best combination of quality and affordability?"

### Location-Focused Queries
- "What's the closest hospital for emergency care near 10032?"
- "Find good hospitals for cancer treatment in Brooklyn"

## üéØ Ranking Algorithm

The application uses a sophisticated composite scoring system:

```python
# Composite Value Score Calculation
cost_score = 1,000,000 / max(cost, 1000)           # 40% weight
rating_score = (rating or 5.0) * 15                # 35% weight  
distance_score = max(0, 100 - (distance * 1.5))    # 15% weight
volume_score = min(log(volume + 1) * 10, 50)       # 10% weight

value_score = cost_score * 0.4 + rating_score * 0.35 + 
              distance_score * 0.15 + volume_score * 0.1
```

### Why This Approach?
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Inverse scoring rewards lower costs
- **Quality Assurance**: Strong weighting on patient ratings
- **Proximity Preference**: Distance penalty for convenience
- **Experience Factor**: Logarithmic volume scoring for diminishing returns

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Decisions

### 1. Composite Ranking vs Single Metric
**Decision**: Multi-factor scoring instead of simple cost or rating sorting
**Rationale**: Real healthcare decisions involve balancing multiple factors - cost, quality, location, and provider experience

### 2. Async Architecture
**Decision**: FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy and asyncpg
**Rationale**: Better performance for I/O-heavy operations like database queries and AI API calls

### 3. Geographic Coordinate Storage
**Decision**: Store lat/lng coordinates directly in database
**Rationale**: Enables accurate radius calculations without external geocoding APIs

### 4. Intent-Aware AI Processing
**Decision**: Detect user intent (cheapest/best-rated/value) and optimize accordingly  
**Rationale**: Users have different priorities - system should adapt ranking to match intent

### 5. Fallback Search Strategies
**Decision**: Multiple fallback approaches when exact matches fail
**Rationale**: Provides better user experience by finding relevant alternatives
