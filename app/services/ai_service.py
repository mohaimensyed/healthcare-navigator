        Question: {question}
        
        Rules:
        1. Only return the SQL query, no explanations
        2. Use proper JOIN syntax when needed
        3. For location-based queries, use ZIP codes or city names
        4. For DRG matching, use ILIKE with partial matches
        5. For cost queries, sort by average_covered_charges
        6. For rating queries, join with ratings table and use AVG()
        7. Limit results to reasonable numbers (10-50)
        8. Use PostgreSQL syntax
        
        Example queries:
        - "cheapest hospitals for knee replacement near 10001" â†’ 
          SELECT p.*, AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating FROM providers p
